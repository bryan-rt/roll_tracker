# CLAUDE.md — Roll Tracker

This file is the persistent context bridge for Claude Code CLI. Every `claude` session
in this repo reads this file automatically. Keep it current after significant changes.

---

## Working Methodology

This project uses a "Web-Brain / CLI-Hands" collaboration model. Read this section
before starting any non-trivial task.

### Your Role (CLI)
The CLI owns the *how*. The web session (claude.ai) owns the *what* and *why*.
Every task arrives as a Task Brief from the web session. Do not make architectural
decisions independently — if something in the Task Brief is ambiguous or conflicts
with the codebase, pause and surface it before proceeding.

### The Three-Pass Protocol (required for all non-trivial tasks)

**Always start a new session with Plan Mode: hit `shift+tab` twice before doing anything.**

```
PASS 1 — Explore (Plan Mode)
  Read the Task Brief carefully
  Explore the relevant files in the repo
  Understand the actual current state of the code
  Identify any conflicts with the Task Brief or CLAUDE.md conventions
  ⏸ STOP — summarize findings and wait for user approval before Pass 2

PASS 2 — Specify (Plan Mode continues)
  Plan the exact changes needed
  Verify naming conventions against live code
  Check data contracts (F0 layer) for compatibility
  Resolve edge cases using evidence from the actual files
  ⏸ STOP — present the plan and wait for user approval before Pass 3

PASS 3 — Execute
  Implement the approved plan
  Run tests or validate pipeline output
  Update CLAUDE.md if architecture or conventions changed
  Commit with a descriptive message and push to GitHub
  ⏸ STOP — summarize what was done and wait for user review
```

**Never skip a pause.** User approval gates each pass. Do not run Pass 2 immediately
after Pass 1, and do not run Pass 3 immediately after Pass 2.

### Evidence-Driven Design

We do not code based on assumptions. When behavior is uncertain:
1. Prefer to enhance logging and collect real artifacts first
2. Inspect existing parquet/JSONL outputs before designing a fix
3. Run the pipeline with debug flags and examine the output
4. Plan from evidence, not speculation

If a Task Brief asks you to fix something but the root cause is unclear, say so.
Propose an instrumentation step before a fix step. Speculation is a last resort.

### What to Do With Ambiguity
- Naming conflict with existing code? Surface it in Pass 1, don't resolve it silently.
- Task Brief references a file that doesn't exist? Report it, don't create it unilaterally.
- Architectural question not covered in CLAUDE.md? Pause and flag it — don't guess.

## Project Identity

**Name:** Roll Tracker
**Author:** Bryan Thomas
**GitHub:** https://github.com/bryan-rt/roll_tracker
**Status:** POC → MVP transition
**Goal:** Multi-service SaaS pipeline for BJJ gyms. Streams Nest camera footage, aligns
it to a gym mat blueprint via homography, tracks athletes (YOLO + BoT-SORT), uses
AprilTags for online identity labeling, and ILP/MCF for offline match stitching.
Produces per-athlete match clips persisted to Supabase and queryable via a Flutter app.

## CV Pipeline Stages (A → F)

The pipeline has two phases:

**Phase 1 — Online single-pass (multiplex, per-clip)**
- **Stage A** `detect_track`: YOLO detection + BoT-SORT tracking. Outputs
  `detections.parquet`, `tracklet_frames.parquet`, `tracklet_summaries.parquet`,
  `contact_points.parquet`, `audit.jsonl`.
- **Stage B** `masks`: SAM-based refined masks. Currently deferred for POC.
  Falls back to YOLO bbox masks.
- **Stage C** `tags`: AprilTag identity anchoring.
  - C0: scheduling/cadence — scannability map + gating + trigger logic
  - C1: ROI scan + raw tag observations
  - C2: voting + conflict resolution → identity hints
  - Outputs: `tag_observations.jsonl`, `identity_hints.jsonl`

**Phase 2 — Offline multi-pass**
- **Stage D** `stitch`: Global MCF/ILP identity stitching. Sub-steps D0–D4:
  - D0: tracklet bank tables
  - D1: graph build (merge/split triggers, group spans)
  - D2: constraint generation
  - D3: ILP compile + solve (two solvers: `d3_ilp`, `d3_ilp2`)
  - D4: emit resolved person_tracks
  - Uses Google OR-Tools for ILP solver backend.
- **Stage E** `matches`: Match session detection from resolved tracks.
- **Stage F** `export`: ffmpeg clip cutting, redaction, Supabase DB write, manifest.

**Orchestration CLI:**
```bash
python -m bjj_pipeline.stages.orchestration.cli run   --input data/raw/nest/cam03/... --camera cam03
python -m bjj_pipeline.stages.orchestration.cli status --clip-id <clip_id>
python -m bjj_pipeline.stages.orchestration.cli validate --clip-id <clip_id>
```
Resume logic is config-hash-aware: stages only re-run if required outputs are missing
or config changed.

---

## CV Design Constraints

**AprilTag family: 36h11** (~587 distinct IDs). Family selected to maximize
cell size within an 11x11 inch physical tag printed on athlete apparel. Larger
cells improve detection reliability for fixed Nest cameras operating at gym
distances under real conditions: variable resolution, lens distortion, partial
occlusion common in BJJ. Detection range directly affects the density of
tag observations fed to the Stage D ILP solver — more observations = stronger
identity constraints = better stitching quality.

**Do not upgrade tag family** without re-evaluating detection reliability.
A larger family (e.g. tagStandard41h12) means smaller cells at the same
physical print size, which reduces the effective detection radius per camera.

**Scale beyond 587 athletes:** handled via WiFi-based gym check-in, not tag
family migration. `tag_id` is unique within `(tag_id + gym_id + active session)`.
The schema supports collision gracefully — Stage F uses check-in records to
disambiguate when multiple athletes globally share a `tag_id`.

---

## Data Contracts (F0 Layer)

All inter-stage data lives on disk under `outputs/<clip_id>/`. The F0 layer enforces this:
- `f0_manifest.py` — `ClipManifest` dataclass, init/load/write, per-stage default registration
- `f0_paths.py` — `ClipOutputLayout`, `StageLetter` — canonical path resolution
- `f0_parquet.py` — Parquet read/write helpers
- `f0_models.py` — Shared Pydantic models
- `f0_validate.py` — Post-stage validators

**Rule:** Stages communicate only via the manifest + filesystem. No stage imports another
stage's internals directly.

---

## Docker Services

| Service | Status | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `nest_recorder` | Working | OAuth2 → Nest API → MP4 segments. Production path: `data/raw/nest/{gym_id}/{cam_id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{HH}/`. Diag path (no GYM_ID): `data/raw/nest/diag/{TS}/`. Auto-registers cameras to Supabase. `entrypoint.sh` delegates to `diag_v8.sh` scheduler. |
| `processor` | Working | Polls `data/raw/nest/` for new MP4s, invokes `bjj_pipeline` (A→F), writes gym-scoped outputs to `outputs/{gym_id}/{cam_id}/{date}/{hour}/{clip_id}/`. Skips already-processed clips. Config: `SCAN_ROOT`, `OUTPUT_ROOT`, `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, `RUN_UNTIL`, `GYM_ID`. |
| `uploader` | Working | Polls `outputs/`, bundles + uploads to Supabase, resolves fighter tag IDs → profile IDs via active gym check-ins, deletes on confirm |

The processor service has a documented I/O contract at `services/processor/contracts/input_output.md`.
The uploader contract is at `services/uploader/contracts/batch_bundle.md`.
Idempotency is critical for the uploader — re-runs must not duplicate uploads.

---

## Supabase Schema (current migrations)

**Tables:**
- `profiles` — athlete/user records. `auth_user_id` (FK to Supabase Auth), `display_name` (nullable), `email`, `tag_id` (auto-assigned 0–586 via sequence), `tag_assigned_at`, `home_gym_id` FK→gyms
- `videos` — raw video metadata: `camera_id`, `source_path`, `recorded_at`, `status`, `metadata` (jsonb), `gym_id` FK→gyms
- `clips` — processed clips: `video_id` FK, `match_id`, `file_path`, `storage_bucket`, `storage_object_path`, `start_seconds`, `end_seconds`, `fighter_a_tag_id`, `fighter_b_tag_id`, `fighter_a_profile_id`, `fighter_b_profile_id` (nullable FKs→profiles)
- `log_events` — audit log: `clip_id`/`video_id` FK, `event_type`, `event_level`, `message`, `details`
- `gyms` — `name`, `owner_profile_id`, `owner_auth_user_id` (denormalized), `address`, `wifi_ssid`, `wifi_bssid`, `latitude`, `longitude`
- `gym_checkins` — `profile_id`, `gym_id`, `checked_in_at`, `auto_expires_at` (trigger-managed +3hr), `is_active`, `source` (`manual` or `wifi_auto`)
- `gym_subscriptions` — `gym_id`, `tier` ENUM, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `is_current`
- `cameras` — `gym_id` FK→gyms, `cam_id` (last 6 chars of SDM device path), `device_path` (full SDM path), `display_name` (nullable, from Google Home room name), `is_active`, `first_seen_at`, `last_seen_at`. Unique on `(gym_id, cam_id)`. Auto-registered by `nest_recorder` on camera discovery via Supabase REST upsert.
- `homography_configs` — `gym_id`, `camera_id`, `config_data` JSONB
- `gym_interest_signals` — `profile_id`, `gym_name_entered`, `owner_email`, `submitted_at`

**Storage bucket:** `match-clips` (private, RLS policy allows authenticated reads for signed URLs)

**Auth trigger:** `handle_new_user()` fires on `auth.users` INSERT — auto-creates `profiles` row with `auth_user_id`, `email`, `tag_id` (from cycling sequence 0–586), `tag_assigned_at`.

**Helper functions:**
- `gyms_near(lat, lng, radius_km)` — Haversine proximity search, no PostGIS
- `current_profile_id()` — SECURITY DEFINER helper for RLS policies that need the current user's profile ID without recursion

**RLS:** Enabled on all 10 tables. Athletes see own profile/clips/check-ins. Gym owners see their gym's data. Service role bypasses all RLS. Note: the gym-owner-reads-checked-in-athlete-profiles policy was dropped due to cross-table RLS recursion (42P17) — will be re-implemented as a SECURITY DEFINER RPC function.

**Pending schema items (not yet migrated):**
- `notification_channel` — TBD (drift alert delivery mechanism)
- Gym owner profile read policy — needs RPC-based approach to avoid RLS recursion

**Applied migrations (Phase A):**
- `20260311000001_create_gyms.sql` — `gyms` table
- `20260311000002_create_gym_members.sql` — (**superseded by 000007** — dropped)
- `20260311000003_create_gym_subscriptions.sql` — `gym_subscriptions` table
- `20260311000004_create_gym_checkins.sql` — `gym_checkins` table + `set_checkin_expiry` trigger
- `20260311000005_create_homography_configs.sql` — `homography_configs` table
- `20260311000006_add_phase_a_columns.sql` — `tag_id`, `gym_id`, `fighter_*_profile_id` columns
- `20260311000007_phase_a_correction.sql` — drops `gym_members`, adds `home_gym_id`, creates `gym_interest_signals`

**Applied migrations (Phase E + bug fixes):**
- `20260315000001_phase_e_rls_and_trigger.sql` — `display_name` nullable, `owner_email` column, auth trigger, `gyms_near()`, RLS on all tables
- `20260315000002_fix_profiles_update_policy.sql` — adds WITH CHECK to profiles UPDATE policy
- `20260315000003_fix_profiles_select_recursion.sql` — `current_profile_id()` SECURITY DEFINER helper
- `20260315000004_fix_current_profile_id_lang.sql` — switches helper to plpgsql to prevent inlining
- `20260315000005_fix_profiles_recursion_v3.sql` — `owner_auth_user_id` denormalized on gyms
- `20260315000006_drop_recursive_profile_policy.sql` — drops recursive gym-owner profiles policy
- `20260315000007_checkin_source_and_tag_assignment.sql` — `source` column on gym_checkins, `tag_id_seq` cycling sequence (0–586), updated `handle_new_user()` to assign tag_id
- `20260315000008_storage_policies.sql` — storage read policy for `match-clips` bucket

**Applied migrations (cameras + recorder):**
- `20260316000001_cameras_table.sql` — `cameras` table with `(gym_id, cam_id)` unique constraint, RLS for gym owner SELECT/UPDATE

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| CV pipeline | Python 3.12, YOLO v8 (ultralytics), BoT-SORT (boxmot) |
| Object detection | YOLOv8n (detection), YOLOv8s-seg (segmentation, optional) |
| Segmentation | SAM (deferred) |
| Tracking | BoT-SORT via boxmot |
| Identity anchoring | AprilTags (apriltag lib) |
| ILP solver | Google OR-Tools 9.12 |
| Data format | Parquet (pyarrow), JSONL for audit |
| Config | YAML + Pydantic v2 |
| Services | Docker (each service is standalone) |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Realtime) |
| Mobile app | Flutter + supabase_flutter + geolocator + video_player |
| Web app | Vite + React + react-router-dom + @supabase/supabase-js |

**Key dependency constraints:**
- NumPy pinned to `1.x` (`<2`) — Torch/NumPy ABI incompatibility with 2.x
- Install `ultralytics` and `boxmot` with `--no-deps` to prevent opencv-python forcing NumPy 2.x
- Python 3.12 target; `>=3.10` minimum per pyproject.toml

---

## Config Resolution Order

1. `configs/default.yaml` (safe defaults)
2. `configs/cameras/<camera_id>.yaml` (per-camera overrides)
3. `configs/cameras/<camera_id>/homography.json` (homography matrix)
4. `--config` CLI overlay (optional, highest priority)

---

## Coding Conventions

- **Modularity first** — this is a SaaS product in development. Correctness and ability
  to change are paramount. Prefer clean module boundaries over cleverness.
- Stage `run()` functions have a stable contract: `run(config: dict, inputs: dict) -> dict`
- No stage imports another stage's internals. All inter-stage data flows through F0 contracts.
- Pydantic v2 for all data models.
- Loguru for logging (not stdlib logging).
- Rich for CLI output.
- Typer for CLI definitions.
- Parquet for all tabular inter-stage data. JSONL for audit/event streams.
- Type hints everywhere. Pyrightconfig is present — keep type coverage clean.
- Debug artifacts go under `outputs/<clip_id>/_debug/`. Never pollute stage output dirs.
- Avoid hardcoding paths. Use `ClipOutputLayout` and environment variables for path resolution.
- **Evidence over assumption** — if a behavior is unclear, add logging and inspect real
  output before writing a fix. Do not guess at root causes.

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Supabase as hub** — no direct service-to-service communication. All clients
  (mobile, web, pipeline) read/write only Supabase. Drift alerts flow:
  CV pipeline detects drift → writes `drift_alert` row → Supabase Realtime
  → push notification to gym owner.
- **Offline-first pipeline** — pipeline runs locally/on-prem, uploads artifacts afterward.
  Not a streaming/real-time inference system.
- **AprilTags for identity** — athletes wear AprilTag IDs. Online pass observes tags,
  offline ILP pass resolves global identities across tracklet fragments.
- **MCF/ILP for stitching** — tracklet identity assignment treated as a min-cost flow
  problem. OR-Tools solver. Two ILP solver variants exist (d3_ilp, d3_ilp2) — d3_ilp2
  is the current preferred path.
- **Stage B (SAM masks) deferred** — POC uses YOLO bbox masks. SAM integration exists
  but is not required for MVP.
- **Three-pass protocol** — Plan Mode (shift+tab x2) for Pass 1+2, execute for Pass 3.
  User approves between each pass. See Working Methodology section above.
- **Processor service is a scaffold** — the Python pipeline runs standalone locally.
  Dockerizing it is a near-term MVP task.

## Active Decisions Log

| Decision | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AprilTag family: 36h11 (~587 IDs) | Decided | Cell size optimized for fixed Nest cameras at gym distances. Larger cells = better detection at range, through occlusion, and at lower resolution. No family migration planned. |
| Check-in mechanism: WiFi SSID+BSSID | Decided | GPS rejected (indoor unreliable, high permission friction). Auto-triggers on WiFi connect in Flutter app. 3hr TTL auto-expiry. gyms table gets wifi_ssid + wifi_bssid columns. |
| profiles.tag_id not globally unique | Decided | tag_id is unique within (tag_id + gym_id + active time window). Handles scale beyond 587 without schema change. Stage F uses check-in to disambiguate if collision exists. |
| Athlete tag assignment: DB-assigned at signup | Decided | `tag_id_seq` cycling sequence (0–586) assigned by `handle_new_user()` trigger on sign-up. Physical merchandise (2 rashguards + 2 gi patches) ships with athlete's distinct tag printed. Replacements available on request. |
| Gym membership: single gym per athlete | Decided | `profiles.home_gym_id` FK (replaced `gym_members` join table). Can relax later. |
| Subscription history: gym_subscriptions table | Decided | Separate table from day one. Fields: gym_id, tier, started_at, ended_at, is_current. |
| Clip identity: denormalized profile IDs on clips | Decided | clips gets fighter_a_profile_id + fighter_b_profile_id (nullable FKs). Stage F writes tag IDs; the uploader service resolves tag → profile via active gym check-ins at upload time. Null = unresolved, backfillable. |
| Camera auto-registration: discovery-derived cam_id | Decided | `cam_id` = last 6 chars of SDM device path. `nest_recorder` auto-registers cameras to `cameras` table via Supabase REST upsert on every discovery run. Replaces manual DEVICE_*/CAM_ID_* env var configuration. `register_cameras.sh` called from `diag_v7_2.sh` after discovery, before recording. |
| Recording file path: gym-scoped production path | Decided | Production: `data/raw/nest/{gym_id}/{cam_id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{HH}/{cam_id}-{timestamp}.mp4`. Diag (no GYM_ID): `data/raw/nest/diag/{TS}/`. GYM_ID presence is the mode switch. `entrypoint.sh` delegates to `diag_v8.sh` scheduler (replaces legacy `record_window.sh` call). |
| Pipeline ingest path: gym-scoped, backward compatible | Decided | Pipeline accepts both `data/raw/nest/{gym_id}/{cam_id}/{date}/{hour}/` (new) and `data/raw/nest/{cam_id}/{date}/{hour}/` (legacy). `gym_id` inferred from path structure (date folder position detection), stored in `ClipManifest.gym_id` (None for legacy). No new CLI argument required. |
| Pipeline output path: gym-scoped | Decided | Outputs at `outputs/{gym_id}/{cam_id}/{date}/{hour}/{clip_id}/stage_*/`. Legacy fallback: `outputs/legacy/{cam_id}/{date}/{hour}/{clip_id}/`. `ClipOutputLayout.root` set from `compute_output_root()`. Stage F reads `gym_id` from manifest (fallback to config). |

## Current Branch & Status

- **Active branch:** `services_uploader`
- **Head commit:** `d0cf43e`
- **Pipeline:** Full pipeline (A→F) verified end-to-end. Ingest accepts gym-scoped paths (`{gym_id}/{cam_id}/{date}/{hour}/`) and legacy paths (`{cam_id}/{date}/{hour}/`). `gym_id` stored in `ClipManifest`. Stages A, C produce tag observations + identity hints. Stage D (ILP stitching) resolves person tracks. Stage E detects match sessions. Stage F exports clips with privacy redaction.
- **Services:** `nest_recorder` working — auto-registers cameras to Supabase on discovery. `uploader` working — resolves fighter tag IDs → profile IDs via active gym check-ins at upload time (Phase C identity bridge). `processor` scaffold only.
- **Apps:** Flutter mobile app at `app_mobile/`. End-to-end tested on Pixel 7 Pro against local Supabase.
  - **Auth:** Supabase-native (supabase_flutter). Auth trigger auto-creates profiles with tag_id on sign-up. Biometric login gated behind Settings toggle (default off).
  - **Onboarding:** display name → gym select → invite gym (if not listed). Routes via AuthGate FutureBuilder with profile completeness check.
  - **Clips:** Pull-to-refresh clip list. Tap to play via signed URL + video_player. RLS scopes clips to athlete's profile (fighter_a/b_profile_id match).
  - **Check-in:** WiFi auto check-in (CheckinService) fires after auth + on WiFi changes. Manual check-in via Find a Gym screen. SSID-primary matching (BSSID optional refinement). Source tracked as `wifi_auto` or `manual`.
  - **Gym discovery:** Find a Gym screen with GPS proximity via `gyms_near` RPC. Accessible from navigation drawer.
  - **Android:** `usesCleartextTraffic=true` for local HTTP Supabase. `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` required for WiFi SSID + GPS.
  - **Local dev:** `supabase_config.dart` points to LAN IP (`192.168.0.66:54321`). Signed URLs rewrite `127.0.0.1` → configured host for phone access.
- **Web app:** Vite + React at `app_web/`. Supabase auth via `@supabase/supabase-js`, client-side routing via `react-router-dom`.
  - `/` — Mat blueprint editor (Konva canvas, drag-and-drop mat sections, import/export JSON)
  - `/admin/pricing` — Admin-only business model pricing simulator (4 tabs: Model, Unit Economics, Sensitivity, Notes). Gated by `AdminGate` component checking session email against `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL` env var.
  - **Auth:** `AdminGate` wraps protected routes. Email+password sign-in via Supabase. Admin email checked from env, never hardcoded.
  - **Local dev:** `.env.example` provided. Set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`.
- **Supabase:** All Phase A + Phase E + cameras migrations applied (17 migration files total). RLS on all 10 tables. Storage read policy on `match-clips` bucket. `cameras` table auto-populated by `nest_recorder`. `log_events` has a known schema mismatch — `AppLogger` sends `app_version` column that doesn't exist (non-blocking, errors are caught).
- **Last updated:** 2026-03-17 (processor service implemented; gym-scoped output paths; Stage F gym_id from manifest; legacy path fallback)
